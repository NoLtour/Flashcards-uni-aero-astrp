Explain how interference drag is generated, state an example and methods for prevention.

Back: 
- Typically interference drag is only described as such when looking at the interference caused from a zero-lift component and something else
- Examples:
	- The fuselage and the wing, interference drag at the interface
	- Wing pylons and the wing
- It can be reduced using suitable aerodynamic fairings and joints, optimising to minimise turbulence/separation around the joint

How does a winged body plane reduce interference drag?

Back: 
- There are less interfaces between different bodies and the main wing since the body is the main wing (no fuselage and it's corresponding joints)
- Less interfaces means less interference drag

What is wave drag, describe how it can occur and how it increases drag.

Back: 
- Wave drag is the drag that occurs due to localised supersonic effects on the airfoil
- On any airfoil their will be variations in the flow speed along it's surface, including regions of accelerated flow 
- When travelling at transonic speeds ~Ma 0.7, there will begin to be localised regions where the flow speed exceeds Mach 1
- These localised regions of supersonic flow will tend to decelerate again leading to a supersonic -> subsonic transition which causes the formation of a normal shock
- Drag from pressure gradient
	- The normal shock creates a very high pressure region behind the shock
	- This creates a large pressure gradient which leads to boundary layer separation, creating large amounts of drag
- Drag from entropy change
	- Since there is an entropy increase across the shock we know that there is a direct loss of useful energy (in this case KE)

Where on a wing does wave drag usually begin to occur? Why?

Back: 
- Wave drag is caused by locally exceeding Mach 1
- The upper surface of a wing typically has higher flow speed than the lower surface
- The region of fastest flow is where wave separation will occur first, hence it will most often occur first on the top of a wing

How can wave drag be reduced?

Back: 
- Operating the vehicle at lower velocities to avoid forming regions of supersonic flow 
- Changing the geometry of the wing
	- Design it so that the flow acceleration is reduced, meaning higher operational speeds before the formation of supersonic regions
	- Design the aerofoil so that the normal shocks occur further along the chord, meaning that the region over which the flow is separated is reduced and so the drag is reduced

I'm designing a RC plane, why do I probably not care at all about wave drag.

Back: 
- It is unlikely to fly anywhere near transonic speeds
- Wave drag only occurs at ~0.7 Mach
- The vehicle will (almost certainly) not have any wave drag regardless of geometry

What is vortex-induced drag? How is it modelled?

Back: 
- Vortex-induced drag is the drag generated by the downwash of the main wing
- In the process of generating lift the velocity vector of air around the wing is rotated, conservation of momentum makes it clear that doing so will not only produce lift but also drag
- From thin aerofoil theory we describe it as a function of the square of lift coefficient:

$$ \begin{align}
C_{Di} &= C_{L} \varepsilon = \frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi A e} 
\end{align} $$

How can vortex-induced drag be reduced?

Back: 
- Reducing the lift generated, to do this the weight of the aircraft needs to be reduced.
- Using knowledge from finite wing theory
	- Increasing aspect ratio, long slender wings
	- Change $e$, make the span wise lift distribution closer to elliptical

What is profile drag? (aka parasitic drag) How can it's components be characterised?

Back: 
- These are drag forces not directly associated with the production of lift
- We characterise the contributions to profile drag using the two phenomena:
	- Skin friction, frictional forces that act tangentially to the body including drag
	- Pressure forces, caused by local flow conditions which act perpendicular to the body

How does skin friction contribute to drag, what can make it larger/smaller?

Back: 
- Skin friction is a component of profile drag
- Skin friction is caused by the velocity gradient near the wall (where KE is transferred from the air to the wall)
	- In laminar flow the velocity gradient is more gradual so it has low skin friction
	- Turbulant flow has more mixing, hence a more even velocity distribution. This leads to a steeper velocity gradient near the wall and more skin drag
- By keeping flow laminar skin friction can be reduced

How can we reduce skin friction drag?

Back: 
- To reduce skin friction we want to minimise the region of turbulant flow by delaying/avoiding flow transition
- Reduce the operating Reynolds number (wing chord or operating speed)
- Improve the surface finish, lower roughness means that there are less initiation points for turbulant transition
- The geometry of the wing can be changed

The wing of a glider experiences a laminar to turbulant transition half way along the top surface of it's wing. Does the wing experience stall?

Back: 
- Stall is caused by flow separation, which occurs when the average velocity along the top of the wing stagnates or reverses
- Turbulant flow does not necessarily mean that the flow has separated, so there is not enough information to tell if the wing is stalled

Describe how wing thickness can be changed to help to maintain a laminar flow?

Back: 
- By maintaining a relatively constant thickness along the length of the wing the pressure gradient can be reduced
- This helps to delay laminar to turbulant flow transition

Why is this cringe?

![[Pasted image 20230407110919.png]]

Back: 
- The high surface roughness caused by the rivets create turbulence, increasing skin drag

Why is pressure drag a consequence of skin friction drag?

Back: 
- Pressure drag exists due to the difference in pressure between the front and back of objects
- Pressure loss is a consequence of frictional forces such as skin friction
- Hence pressure drag is caused by skin friction
