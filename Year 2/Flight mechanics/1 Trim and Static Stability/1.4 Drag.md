TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::1 Trim and Static Stability



START_CARD
Basic

State the names and associated descriptions of the following variables:
- $D_{int}$
- $D_{pro}$
- $D_{wav}$
- $D_{i}$
- $D_{m}$

Back: 
- $D_{int}$, Interference Drag: Drag resulting from bringing two bodies in proximity to each other
- $D_{pro}$, Profile Drag: Drag due to the sum of skin friction drag and pressure drag (form drag)
- $D_{wav}$ Wave Drag: Drag resulting from compressibility effects
- $D_{i}$ Vortex-Induced Drag: Drag resulting from trailing vortices at the tips of a finite wing
- $D_{m}$ Trim Drag: Change of drag due to the tail-planeâ€™s contribution at a trim condition
