START_CARD
Basic

State the equation for max cruise/loiter performance.

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\left(\frac{C_{L*}}{C_{D}}\right)_{max} &= \sqrt{ \frac{\pi}{C_{d{0}}} \frac{d(2-d)}{4} \left(Ae + \frac{S_{T}}{S} A_{T} e_{T}\right) }
\end{align} $$

What is the equation for determining the neutral point of a stick fixed aircraft?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
h_{n} - h &= H_\text{s, stick\:fixed} = - Kk \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} \frac{\Delta \eta}{\Delta C_{L*}}
\end{align} $$

What is the equation for determining the neutral point of a stick free aircraft?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
h_{n} - h &= H_\text{s, stick\:free} = - K\bar{k} \frac{\bar{a}_{3}}{\bar{a}_{1}} \frac{\Delta \beta}{\Delta C_{L*}}
\end{align} $$

Basic

Expand the following into derivates, giving brief descriptions. State if they are typically positive or negative.
- $a_{1}$
- $a_{2}$
- $a_{3}$

Back: 
- Typically all positive
- $a_{1} = \frac{\delta C_{LT}}{\delta \alpha_{eff}}$, how the lift of the tail varies with the effective angle of attack (a function of downwash, setting angle and AOA)
- $a_{2} = \frac{\delta C_{LT}}{\delta \eta}$, how the lift of the tail varies with the deflection of the elevator
- $a_{3} = \frac{\delta C_{LT}}{\delta \beta}$, how the lift of the tail varies with the deflection of the trim tab

Basic

Expand the following into derivates, giving brief descriptions. State if they are typically positive or negative.
- $b_{1}$
- $b_{2}$
- $b_{3}$

Back: 
- Typically all negative
- $b_{1} = \frac{\delta C_{MH}}{\delta \alpha_{eff}}$, how the moment on the hinge of the tail varies with the effective angle of attack (a function of downwash, setting angle and AOA)
- $b_{2} = \frac{\delta C_{MH}}{\delta \eta}$, how the  moment on the hinge of the tail varies with the deflection of the elevator
- $b_{3} = \frac{\delta C_{MH}}{\delta \beta}$, how the  moment on the hinge of the tail varies with the deflection of the trim tab
