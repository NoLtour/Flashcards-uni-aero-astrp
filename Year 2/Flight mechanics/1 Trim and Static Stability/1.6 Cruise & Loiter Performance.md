TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::1 Trim and Static Stability

Basic

Describe the influence of each of these drag contributions to overall drag as a function of lift coefficient:

$$ \begin{align}
C_{D} &= C_{D_{0}} + C_{D_{L*}} + C_{D_{m}} 
\end{align} $$

Then re-write the drag equation interms of them.

Back: 

$$ \begin{align}
  C_{D_{0}} &= k & C_{D_{L*}} &\approx \frac{C_{L*}^{2}}{\pi Ae}& C_{D_{m}} &= - \frac{C_{D_{L*}} }{ \sigma }\\
  &&&& &\approx - \frac{C_{L*}^{2}}{\pi Ae \sigma}   \\
\end{align} $$
- $C_{D_{0}}$ is the zero lift drag, it doesn't vary with lift coefficient
- $C_{D_{L*}}$ is the lift dependent drag from an untrimmed state, it is a function of lift coefficient squared
- $C_{D_{m}}$ is the minimum trim drag, it is a function of lift $C_{D_{L*}}$ and therefor a function of lift coefficient squared

$$ \begin{align}
C_{D} &= C_{D_{0}} + C_{D_{L*}} + C_{D_{m}} &&\to & C_{D} &= C_{D_{0}} + \frac{C_{L*}^{2}}{\pi Ae} C_{D_{m}} - \frac{C_{L*}^{2}}{\pi Ae \sigma} &&\to & C_{D} &= C_{D_{0}} + \frac{1}{\pi A e} \left(1- \frac{1}{\sigma} \right)C_{L*}^{2}\\
&& && && &&C_{D} &= X + Y C_{L*}^{2}
\end{align} $$
