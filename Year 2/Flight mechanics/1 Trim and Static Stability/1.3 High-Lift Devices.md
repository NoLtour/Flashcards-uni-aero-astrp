How do flaps work? How do they effect the characteristics of the aircraft?

Back: 
- Flaps serve to increase lift coefficient of an aircraft when deployed
	- Effectively increase the size of the wing and it's camber
- They therefor also massively increase the induced drag coefficient

How do slats work? How do they effect the characteristics of the aircraft?

Back: 
- Slats funnel air in such a way that reduces flow separation
- The primary effect of slats is to increase the max angle of attack before flow seperation occurs

What is a Krueger flap? What does it do?

Back: 
- This is a type of flap that sits on the front of the wing
- A portion of the lower wing is rotated out in front of the wing leading edge
- It's effect on the wing is similar to normal flaps, effectively increasing the camber and size of the wing
	- Increasing max lift coefficient
	- Reducing stall angle

How do flaps effect the static stability characteristics of a plane?

Back: 
- Since they extend the wing backwards they also increase $h_{0}$ (aerodynamic centre moves backwards)
- They make $M_{0}$ more negative (induce a pitching down moment)
- Increase $C_{L}$

How do slats effect the static stability characteristics of a plane?

Back: 
- Since they extend the wing forwards they also decrease $h_{0}$ (aerodynamic centre moves forwards)
- Increase $C_{L}$ slightly

What effect does aircraft body length have on the drag of an aircraft?

Back: 
- A long slender body decreases parasitic drag

In the context of take off why might we want a shorter aircraft body?

Back: 
- The shorter the body the greater AOA can be achieved without the tail hitting the runway
- This means a lower minimum velocity is needed for take off allowing take off from shorter runways
