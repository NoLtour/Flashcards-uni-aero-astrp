What is the underlining principle behind CG position - drag optimisation?

![[Pasted image 20230407121151.png]]

Back: 
- We know that for any plane:
	- Total lift must equal the total weight
	- The tail and main wing lifts must be at values such that net moments is zero (trim)
- We also know that induced drag is a function of lift squared
- It's then clear that by moving the CG forward/backwards we can change the ratio of lift from the main vs tail
- This will not change total lift but will change total induced drag
- There must be some optimal position for the CG to minimise induced drag when in steady level flight

Define trim drag.

Back: 
- It is defined as the difference in drag between  a trimmed case and a reference case.
- The reference case used is untrimmed and takes the main wing to be producing lift equal to the weight (no tail lift)

When considering trim drag, what does this equation mean? Name it's variables and describe it's context. Then state it's non dimensionalised equivalent.

$$ \begin{align}
D_{after} &= D_{0} + D_{L*} + D_{m}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This equation describes the total drag after trim, it is in the context of the trim drag equation

- $D_{after}$ is the total drag after trimming
- $D_{0}$ is the zero lift drag (parasitic drag)
- $D_{L*}$ is the total lift induced drag in the reference case (reference case of the trim drag definition, aka induced drag if the wing was untrimmed and only the main wing produced lift)
- $D_{m}$The change in drag after trimming (this value can be negative)

- The non dimensionalised form is:
- $$ \begin{align}
C_{D_{m}} &= C_{D_{L}} + C_{D_{L_{T}}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} - C_{D_{L*}}
\end{align} $$

$$ \begin{align}
C_{D_{m}} &= C_{D_{L*}} \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} \left( \sigma \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} - 2 \right)
\end{align} $$

For the equation above:
- What part is equivalent to fraction of lift due to tailplane
- The context of the equation
- Name it's variables

Back: 

- This is fraction of total lift due to tailplane
$$ \begin{align}
\frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S}
\end{align} $$

- This equation describes the relationship between trim drag coefficient and the ratio of the coefficient's of lift of the main wing and tail plane, which describes how their relative loading.

- $C_{D_{L*}}$ is the total lift induced drag coefficient in the reference case (reference case of the trim drag definition, aka induced drag if the wing was untrimmed and only the main wing produced lift)
- $C_{D_{m}}$ is the change in drag coefficient after trimming compared to some reference state (this value can be negative)
- $\sigma$ is a convenient variable which is some function of main and tail wing geometry (static for a aircraft)
- $C_{L_{T}}$ the lift coefficient of the tail
- $C_{L*}$ the total lift coefficient
- $S_{T}/S$ the ratio of the tail vs main wing area

$$ \begin{align}

\end{align} $$

- What does this graph show and why is it useful
- Why does the first root make sense 

Back: 
- This graph is a plot of how trim drag varies as the fraction of lift provided by the tail varies
- It shows that at some fraction the trim drag is at a minimum
- Practically this can be used to optimise the drag produced to a minimum by changing the position of the CG

-  $C_{D_{m}}$ is defined as the change in drag coefficient after trimming compared to some reference state
- At the location where $C_{D_{m}}=0$ all lift must be being generated by the main wing
- The definition of this reference state is where all lift is being generated by the main wing

If performing trim drag optimisation, state the equation that describes the occurrence of minimum drag. 

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} &= \frac{1}{\sigma}
\end{align} $$

Using the following equation, how can we find the conditions minimum trim drag?

$$ \begin{align}
C_{D_{m}} &= C_{D_{L*}} \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} \left( \sigma \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{C_{L*}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} - 2 \right)
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- Take it's derivative to find the minimum

Explain why the trim drag is positive when the tail plane lift is negative.

Back: 
- Trim drag is the change in drag after trimming compared to some reference state where all lift is produced by the main wing
- In the event that the tail plane lift is negative the main wing needs to produce more lift to equal the weight
- In this case the main wing and the tail wing will also produce more induced drag compared to it's reference case
- Hence trim drag will be positive
