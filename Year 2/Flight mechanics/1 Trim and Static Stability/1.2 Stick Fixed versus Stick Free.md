TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::1 Trim and Static Stability




START_CARD
Basic

Describe the effects of a stick fixed condition:
- Description of what it is
- The net aerodynamic pitching moments on the elevator
- The conditions on the trim tab
- Advantages/disadvantages

Back: 
Desc:
- This is where the pilot sets the position of the elevator manually by forcefully holding it at some deflection
- Since the elevator is being forced to a certain deflection the net aerodynamic moment acting on the hinge will probably be non zero ($C_{M_{H}}\neq0$)
- The trim tab can typically be assumed to have no deflection relative to the elevator as pilot control is being done through manual deflection of the elevator

Advantages:
- This has the benefit of allowing greater forces to be generated by the elevator when compared to stick free

Disadvantages:
- It is quite demanding on the pilot as the deflection of the tail plane must be actively managed to ensure desirable attitude
- If the tail deflection is controlled by direct mechanical interface the stick that controls the tail may require significant force to maintain desired deflection

START_CARD
Basic

Describe the effects of a stick free condition:
- Description of what it is
- The net aerodynamic pitching moments on the elevator
- The conditions on the trim tab
- Advantages/disadvantages



Back: 
Desc:
- The pilot rotates the trim tab until the elevator hinge moment is zero and the pilot is no longer required to exert a force on the yoke
- The equilibrium state of the elevator is set such that the desired net force is generated by the tailplane
- The aerodynamic moment acting on the hinge will obviously be zero ($C_{M_{H}}=0$)
- Since the trim tab is being used it is clearly at a potentially non zero deflection

Advantages:
- Less attention is needed from the pilot on the state of the tailplane as compared to stick fixed

Disadvantages:
- Some inefficiency is introduced as drag is induced by the trim tab to maintain the position of the elevator
- The maximum force that can be generated by the tail is less when compared to stick fixed
- Disturbances such as gusts can be more disruptive

A plane is flying is steady level flight maintained with a stick free tail plane configuration. A gust acting from the front increases the $V_{\infty}$, how does this effect:
- The effective AOA of the tail plane
- The deflection of the elevator
- The attitude of the aircraft

Assuming a reasonable aircraft configuration.

Back: 
- An increase in the freestream velocity increases the lift produced and therefor the downwash of the main wing
- This intern increases the effective AOA experienced by the tail plane

- The following equation describes the equilibrium condition of a tail plane:
$$ \begin{align}
&& \text{stick }&\text{fixed} && & \text{describe }&\text{change}\\
C_{M_{H}} &= b_{1} \alpha_{T_{eff}} + b_{2} \eta + b_{3} \beta & &\to & 0 &= b_{1} \alpha_{T_{eff}} + b_{2} \eta + b_{3} \beta & &\to &-b_{2} (\Delta \eta) &= b_{1} (\Delta\alpha_{T_{eff}})\\ 
\end{align} $$
- By manipulating it we can see that to maintain it's equilibrium the deflection of the tail will change ($\beta$) 

- The overall attitude of the aircraft will then change

Describe what it means to achieve trim by using a fixed tail configuration.

Back: 
- This is where the tail itself does not change AOA relative to the airframe
- It's elevator may still use a trimtab

Describe what it means to achieve trim by using a all-moving tail

Back: 
- This is where the entire tail essentially acts as a elevator
- Here it is common not to have a trim tab instead using electronics to control the tail

Describe what it means to achieve trim by using a adjustable tail.

Back: 
- This is where the entire tail essentially can have it's angle set
- The tail is adjusted for trim but still uses an elevator for control around trim point
