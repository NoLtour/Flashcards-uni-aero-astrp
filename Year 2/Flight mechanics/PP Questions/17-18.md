Basic

Describe the main features of SPO and phugoid modes.

Back: 

### Phugoid:

- This is a long period mode
- The pitch rate varies, but AOA remains constant (because slow motion)
- This mode is driven by the exchange between GPE and KE

### SPO
![[Pasted image 20230519172109.png]]
- This is a short period mode
- The pitch rate and AOA vary
- It is caused by static stability, which causes the pitch angle to return to zero
- The pitching overshoots, leading to oscillation

START_CARD
Basic

Discuss the handling quality requirements of SPO and phugoid.

Back: 
- The SPO must not be too short, since that could imply a too strong corrective force which would make handling sluggish
- The SPO must be dynamically stable, else it will make the aircraft unsafe to fly
- Ideally the phugoid should also be dynamically stable, but this is less important as the pilot has time for corrective action
- The SPO shouldn't be too short as it could lead to extreme G-forces being experienced by passengers or even structural concerns
