\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} 
\end{align} $$

For this derivative:
- State it's meaning in $d/d$ form
- Describe what it relates on an aircraft
- State what variables describe it
- State it's units
- State the relationship between it's dimensionalised and non dimensionalised forms

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}

- Change in force in the forward ($X$) direction of the aircraft with change in forward velocity ($u$)
- This can be expressed as some function of the drag coefficient
- Units are $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}/\text{s}}$

By definition what is the relationship between $w$ and AOA?

Back: 
- AOA is the angle between the $x$ axis of the aircraft and it's free stream velocity
- Using small angle approximations $w \propto \text{AOA} \to w = U_{\infty} \alpha$
