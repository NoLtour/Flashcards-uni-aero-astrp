Basic

$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} 
\end{align} $$

For this derivative:
- State it's meaning in $d/d$ form
- Describe what it relates on an aircraft
- State it's units
- State the relationship between it's dimensionalised and non dimensionalised forms

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} = \frac{\delta x}{\delta u} 
\end{align} $$

- Change in force in the forward ($X$) direction of the aircraft with change in forward velocity ($u$)
- Units are $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}/\text{s}}$

$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} &= X_{u} \frac{1}{2}\rho
\end{align} $$
