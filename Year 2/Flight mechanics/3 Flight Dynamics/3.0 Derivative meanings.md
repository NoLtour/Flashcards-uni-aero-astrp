$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} 
\end{align} $$

For this derivative:
- State it's meaning in $d/d$ form
- Describe what it relates on an aircraft
- State what variables describe it
- State it's units
- State the relationship between it's dimensionalised and non dimensionalised forms

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} = \frac{\delta x}{\delta u} 
\end{align} $$

- Change in force in the forward ($X$) direction of the aircraft with change in forward velocity ($u$)
- This can be expressed as some function of the drag coefficient
- Units are $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}/\text{s}}$

$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{u} &= X_{u} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}U_{\infty}^{2}S}{U_{\infty}}\\
&=  X_{u}  \frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}U_{\infty} S 
\end{align} $$

$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{w} 
\end{align} $$

For this derivative:
- State it's meaning in $d/d$ form
- Describe what it relates on an aircraft
- State what variables describe it
- State it's units
- State the relationship between it's dimensionalised and non dimensionalised forms

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{w} = \frac{\delta x}{\delta w} 
\end{align} $$

- Change in force in the forward ($X$) direction of the aircraft with change in upward velocity ($w$)
- It is strongly related to AoA (lift coefficient) and induced drag
- Units are $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}/\text{s}}$

$$ \begin{align}
\stackrel{\circ}{X}_{w} &= X_{w} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}U_{\infty}^{2}S}{U_{\infty}}\\
&=  X_{w}  \frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}U_{\infty} S

For this derivative:
- State it's meaning in $d/d$ form
- Describe what it relates on an aircraft

- Change in force in the upward ($Z$) direction of the aircraft with change in forward velocity ($u$) 
- 
- Units are $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}/\text{s}}$
