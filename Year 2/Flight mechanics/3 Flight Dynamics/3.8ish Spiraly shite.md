- Roll subsidence mode is simply the damping of rolling motion. 
- There is no direct aerodynamic moment created tending to directly restore wings-level, i.e. there is no returning "spring force/moment" proportional to roll angle. However, there is a damping moment (proportional to roll rate) created by the slewing-about of long wings.

- Most aircraft trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, will eventually develop a tightening spiral-dive. (If a spiral dive is entered unintentionally, the result can be fatal.)
- The spiral is primarily driven by GPE -> KE as it accelerates downwards into a tighter spiral, increasing in speed and G force on the airframe

Which of the following is  Dutch roll, briefly describe what Dutch roll is.

- The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on.

Based on what roll damping/roll subsidence is, state it's approximation and why it's derived that way.

Back: 
- Roll damping is simply the mode where roll is damped
- It's just going to be a function of roll moment's caused by roll and the rolling inertia of the vehicle

$$ \begin{align}
&& p&= p_{0} e^{\lambda}t \\
I_{xx} \dot{p} &= \stackrel{\circ}{L}_{p} p & &\to & I_{xx} \lambda p_{0} e^{\lambda t} &= \stackrel{\circ}{L}_{p} p_{0} e^{\lambda}t \\
&& && I_{xx} \lambda   &= \stackrel{\circ}{L}_{p}  \\
&& &&  \lambda   &= \frac{\stackrel{\circ}{L}_{p}}{I_{xx}} \\
\end{align} $$

Describe the main way Dutch roll can be counteracted.

Back: 
- Since it's caused by over compensating yaw leading to oscillations sideways
- Counter it with yaw damping
