State what is this equivalent to and explain what it represents:

$$ \begin{align}
\int \textbf{r} \times \textbf{v} \:dm
\end{align} $$

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\textbf{h} &= \int \textbf{r} \times \textbf{v} \:dm
\end{align} $$

- This is angular momentum.
- It represents the net rotational momentum around some point (typically CG)

State which products of inertia can be assumed to be zero and non zero in a typical aircraft. Explain why that is.

Back: 
- $I_{xy}=0$
- $I_{xz}\neq 0$
- $I_{yz}=0$ 

- $I_{xx}\neq0$
- $I_{yy}\neq0$
- $I_{zz}\neq0$

- Both $I_{xy}$ and $I_{yz}$ typically have symmetry about their $x$ and $z$ lines respectively
- Considering the definition of their values are 
$$ \begin{align}
I_{xy} &= \int xy \: dm & I_{yz} &= \int yz \: dm 
\end{align} $$
- The symmetry leads to a zero value

For a equation what is the meaning of:
$$ \begin{align}
 &=_{1} 
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This means that the equation is a first order approximation
- Meaning higher order terms are neglected

Describe what is meant by stability axis. What does it imply about other variables?

Back: 
- This is a convenient coordinate system state where the freestream velocity vector is aligned with the x axis
- By definition:
	- $U=U_{\infty}$
	- $V=0$
	- $U=0$

$$ \begin{align}
L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xy} \frac{dq}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt} + q (-I_{xz} p - I_{yz}q + I_{zz} r) - r (-I_{xy} p + I_{yy} q - I_{yz} r)
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- State what it describes
- Where it comes from
- It's assumptions
- Name it's variables

Back: 
- It describes the moment component acting around the x axis, in the aircrafts reference frame
- It comes from expanding the 3D equation for moments

- It makes no assumptions (except that the effects of relativity are negligible)

- $L$ is the moment component acting on the aircraft around it's x axis
- $I_{xx},I_{yy},I_{zz}$ are moments of inertia around the x,y and z axis respectively
- $p,q,r$ are the aircraft angular velocities around it's x,y and z axis respectively

Simplify the following equation, explaining assumptions used:
$$ \begin{align}
L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xy} \frac{dq}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt} + q (-I_{xz} p - I_{yz}q + I_{zz} r) - r (-I_{xy} p + I_{yy} q - I_{yz} r)
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- By assuming small perturbations we know that angular velocities will be small. Hence we remove where angular velocities re multiplied:
$$ \begin{align}
L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xy} \frac{dq}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt} + q (-I_{xz} p - I_{yz}q + I_{zz} r) - r (-I_{xy} p + I_{yy} q - I_{yz} r) & &\to & \Delta L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xy} \frac{dq}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt}
\end{align} $$

- We can assume that the aircraft is symmetrical along it's xz plane hence $I_{xy}=0$ and $I_{yz}=0$ so:
$$ \begin{align}
\Delta L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xy} \frac{dq}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt} & &\to & \Delta L &= I_{xx} \frac{dp}{dt} - I_{xz} \frac{dr}{dt}\\
&& && &= I_{xx} \dot{p} - I_{xz} \dot{r}

$$ \begin{align}
X &= m \left(\frac{dU}{dt} + qW - rV\right)
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- State what it describes
- Where it comes from
- It's assumptions
- Name it's variables

Back: 
- It describes the velocity component acting in the x axis, in the aircrafts reference frame
- It comes from expanding the 3D equation for force

- It makes no assumptions (except that the effects of relativity are negligible)

- $X$ is the force acting in the x direction
- $\frac{dU}{dt}$ is the rate of change of x velocity
- $q$ is the angular velocity around the y axis (pitch rate)
- $r$ is the angular velocity around the z axis (yaw rate)
- $V$ is the CG velocity in the y axis
- $W$ is the CG velocity in the z axis

Write the following interms of perturbations, then simplify explaining assumptions used:
$$ \begin{align}
X &= m \left(\frac{dU}{dt} + qW - rV\right)
\end{align} $$

Back: 

- First we assume initial conditions have very small AOA and that perturbations and rotation rates are small:
$$ \begin{align}
U &= U_{\infty} + \Delta U = U_{\infty} + u\\
V &= 0 + \Delta V = v\\
W &= 0 + \Delta W = w\\ 
\end{align} $$


- We can then sub these equations in to show what happens under small perturbations:
$$ \begin{align}
X &= m \left(\frac{dU}{dt} + qW - rV\right) & &\to & \Delta X &= m \left(\frac{d(U_{\infty} + u)}{dt} + q w - r v\right) \\
&& && \Delta X &= m \left(\frac{dU_{\infty}}{dt}  + \frac{du}{dt}  + q w - r v\right)\\
&& && \Delta X &= m \left(  \frac{du}{dt}  + q w - r v\right)\\

\end{align} $$

- We then simplify by removing multiplications of small numbers:
$$ \begin{align}
\Delta X &= m \left(\frac{du}{dt} + q w - r v\right) & &\to & \Delta X &= m  \frac{du}{dt}  \\
&& && \Delta X &= m \dot{u} \\
