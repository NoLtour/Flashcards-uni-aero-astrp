How do I apply $\textbf{R}_{BE}$?

Back: 
- This is a rotation matrix for converting earth frame of reference vectors to an aircraft frame of reference
- It is applied like the following:
$$ \begin{align}

\end{align} $$

$$ \begin{align}
\textbf{F}_{B} &= m ( \dot{\textbf{v}}_{B} + \textbf{w}_{B} \times \textbf{v}_{B} ) 
\end{align} $$

For this equation name it's variables and describe it's meaning.


Back: 
For all these vectors, they are in the aircraft's frame of reference:
- $\textbf{F}_{B}$ this is the force vector acting on the aircraft
- $m$ is mass of the aircraft
- $\dot{\textbf{v}}_{B}$ is the acceleration vector acting on the aircraft
- $\textbf{w}_{B}$ is the rotation rate vector
- $\textbf{v}_{B}$ is the velocity vector
- $\times$ is a cross product

- This equation is describing newtons second law in the aircrafts reference frame
