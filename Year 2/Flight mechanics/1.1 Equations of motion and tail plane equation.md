Explain the context of the following equation and describe it's variables:
$$ C_{L^{*}} = C_{L} + C_{L_{T}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} = C_{W} \cos\gamma  $$

- $C_{L^{*}}=$ The coefficient of total lift
- $C_{L}=$ The coefficient of main wing lift
- $C_{L_{T}}=$ The coefficient of lift for the tail plane
- $\frac{S_{T}}{S} =$ The wing area of the tailplane divided by the w
