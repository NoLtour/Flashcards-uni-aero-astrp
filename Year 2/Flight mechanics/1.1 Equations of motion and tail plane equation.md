Explain the context of the following equation and describe it's variables:
$$ C_{L^{*}} = C_{L} + C_{L_{T}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} = C_{W} \cos\gamma  $$

- This equation represents the equilibrium of lift and weight force acting on a aircraft in steady flight.
- $C_{L^{*}}=$ The coefficient of total lift
- $C_{L}=$ The coefficient of main wing lift
- $C_{L_{T}}=$ The coefficient of lift for the tail plane
- $\frac{S_{T}}{S} =$ The wing area of the tailplane divided by the wing area of the main wing
- $C_{W}=$ The coefficient of weight of the aircraft
- $\gamma=$ The angle of climb of the aircraft (Angle between aircraft velocity vector and the horizontal)




Explain the context of the following equation and describe it's variables:
$$ C_{M_{0}} + C_{L^{*}} (h-h_{0}) - C_{L_{T}} K = 0 $$

- $C_{L_{T}}=$ The coefficient of lift for the tail plane
- $C_{L^{*}}=$ The coefficient of total lift
- $C_{M_{0}}=$ The coefficient of wing pitching moment about aerodynamic centre
- $h=$ Distance from main wing leading edge to centre of gravity, divided by the mean aerodynamic chord ($c$)
- $h_{0}=$ Distance from main wing leading edge to aerodynamic centre, divided by the mean aerodynamic chord ($c$)
- $K=$ Tail volume fraction, a constant defined using geometric properties of the aircraft ($K= \frac{S_{T}l}{Sc}$)
