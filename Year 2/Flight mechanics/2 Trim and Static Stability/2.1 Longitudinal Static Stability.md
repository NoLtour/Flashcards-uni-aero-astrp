Starting with the following equation, derive an expression for static stability.

$$ \begin{align}
C_{M_{CG}} &= C_{M_{0}} + C_{L*} ( h - h_{0} ) - C_{L_{T}} K   
\end{align} $$

Back: 

$$ \begin{align}
C_{M_{CG}} &= C_{M_{0}} + C_{L*} ( h - h_{0} ) - C_{L_{T}} K  & &\to & \frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &= \frac{C_{L*}}{d\alpha} ( h - h_{0} ) - \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{d\alpha} K   \\
&& & & \frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &=  C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} ) -  C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K   \\
\end{align} $$

Where $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}<0$ implies static stability.

$$ \begin{align}
\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &=  C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} ) -  C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K
\end{align} $$

For the equation above:
- What does it describe
- Name it's variables
- What does it imply about the contributing factors to an aircrafts static stability

Back: 
- $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}$ describes the response of an aircraft to a change in it's AOA where $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}<0$ implies static stability
- This equation describes the influence of various factors on it's static stability

- $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}$ is the total lift coefficients change with AOA
- $C_{L_{T}, \alpha}$ is the tail lift coefficients change with AOA
- $h$ is the centre of mass position as a fraction of the main wing chord
- $h_{0}$ is the aerodynamic centres position as a fraction of the main wing chord

Influence of $-C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K$ on stability:
- This describes the tails response to changing AOA
- We know that $C_{L_{T}, \alpha}$ will be positive and $K$ is positive
- Hence it's clear that the tails overall contribution is negative
- So this shows us that the tail contributes to improving static stability


Influence of $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} )$ on stability:
- This describes the main wing's moment response to changing AOA
- We know that $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}$ will be positive
- $h - h_{0}$ could be positive or negative depending on the relative position of the centre of mass to aerodynamic centre
	- In the event that the centre of mass is behind of the aerodynamic centre it will be positive, hence this will be an unstable contribution
	- In the event that the centre of mass is in front of the aerodynamic centre it will be negative, hence this will be an stable contribution

To improve the (static) stability of an aircraft the centre of mass can either be moved forwards or backwards, state which direction will improve (static) stability.

Back: 
- Moving it forward will improve stability
- Backward will reduce stability

In static stability analysis, what is the neutral point? What is it's equation?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230407165451.png]]
- The neutral point is the furthest back position (as a fraction of mean chord) that the centre of mass can be before it becomes unstable
- From the equation describing stability we can easily derive the expression for the neutral point:
$$ \begin{align}
0 &=  C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h_{n} - h_{0} ) -  C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K & &\to & h_{n} &= \frac{C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K}{C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}} + h_{0}
\end{align} $$

If the neutral point is very far forward, what does this tell you about the stability characteristics of a aircraft?

Back: 
-  The neutral point is the furthest back position (as a fraction of mean chord) that the centre of mass can be before it becomes unstable
- Without information on the position of the centre of mass we cannot tell if the aircraft is statically stable or not
- Still the aircraft probably has issues related to achieving static stability due to the large tail likely required

Define static stability margin, and it's equation.

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
H_{s} &\equiv h_{n} - h 
\end{align} $$
- $H_{s}$ is static stability margin
- $h_{n}$ is neutral point position (as a fraction of mean chord)
- $h$ is centre of mass position (as a fraction of mean chord)

- Static stability margin is defined as the fraction of chord length from the centre of mass to the neutral point

$$ \begin{align}
H_{S} &= h_{0} - h + K \frac{ C_{L_{T,\alpha}} }{ C_{L*, \alpha} } 
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- What does it describe
- Name it's variables
- What does it tell you

Back: 
- This equation describes the static stability margin of an aircraft which is a measure of static stability

- $H_{s}$ is static stability margin
- $h$ is centre of mass position (as a fraction of mean chord)
- $h_{0}$ is aerodynamic centre position (as a fraction of mean chord)y
- $C_{L*, \alpha}}$ is the total lift coefficients change with AOA
- $C_{L_{T}, \alpha}$ is the tail lift coefficients change with AOA

- It shows you that to maximise stability you want the centre of mass to be as far forward as possible and the aerodynamic centre to be as far back as possible
- It also shows you that you want the lift-AOA slope of the tail plane to be a large relative to the main wing

Explain the following equation and name it's variables.

$$ \begin{align}
\frac{d\alpha_{T_{eff}}}{d\alpha} &= 1 - \varepsilon_{alpha}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- $\varepsilon_{alpha}= \frac{d\varepsilon}{d\alpha}$ is the slope of the effective AOA of the tailplane caused by the downwash of the main wing
- $\frac{d\alpha_{T_{eff}}}{d\alpha}$ is the variation of the tailplane effective AOA with AOA

- The 1 in the equation represents the fact that if the $\alpha$ of the vehicle changes an equal change is added to the tail wing's $\alpha$
- The $- \varepsilon_{alpha}$ is the adjustment due to the downwash of the main wing
