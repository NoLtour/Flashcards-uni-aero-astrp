TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::2 Trim and Static Stability



START_CARD
Basic

Define stable system.

Back: 
- A system where when disturbed from its equilibrium state by a small perturbation then the set of forces and moments so caused initially tend to return the system to its original state

What does pitch stiffness mean?

Back: 
- The tendency of an aircraft to return to a certain AOA when disturbed
- High pitch stiffness implies static stability

Starting with the following equation, derive an expression for static stability.

$$ \begin{align}
C_{M_{CG}} &= C_{M_{0}} + C_{L*} ( h - h_{0} ) - C_{L_{T}} K   
\end{align} $$

Back: 

$$ \begin{align}
C_{M_{CG}} &= C_{M_{0}} + C_{L*} ( h - h_{0} ) - C_{L_{T}} K  & &\to & \frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &= \frac{C_{L*}}{d\alpha} ( h - h_{0} ) - \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{d\alpha} K   \\
&& & & \frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &=  C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} ) -  C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K   \\
\end{align} $$

Where $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}<0$ implies static stability.

$$ \begin{align}
\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha} &=  C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} ) -  C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K
\end{align} $$

For the equation above:
- What does it describe
- Name it's variables
- What does it imply about the contributing factors to an aircrafts static stability

Back: 
- $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}$ describes the response of an aircraft to a change in it's AOA where $\frac{dC_{M_{CG}}}{d\alpha}<0$ implies static stability
- This equation describes the influence of various factors on it's static stability

- $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}$ is the total lift coefficients change with AOA
- $C_{L_{T}, \alpha}$ is the tail lift coefficients change with AOA
- $h$ is the centre of mass position as a fraction of the main wing chord
- $h_{0}$ is the aerodynamic centres position as a fraction of the main wing chord

Influence of $-C_{L_{T}, \alpha}  K$ on stability:
- This describes the tails response to changing AOA
- We know that $C_{L_{T}, \alpha}$ will be positive and $K$ is positive
- Hence it's clear that the tails overall contribution is negative
- So this shows us that the tail contributes to improving static stability


Influence of $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}} ( h - h_{0} )$ on stability:
- This describes the main wing's moment response to changing AOA
- We know that $C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}$ will be positive
- $h - h_{0}$ could be positive or negative depending on the relative position of the centre of mass to aerodynamic centre
	- In the event that the centre of mass is behind of the aerodynamic centre it will be positive, hence this will be an unstable contribution
	- In the event that the centre of mass is in front of the aerodynamic centre it will be negative, hence this will be an stable contribution

To improve the (static) stability of an aircraft the centre of mass can either be moved forwards or backwards, state which direction will improve (static) stability.

Back: 
- Moving it forward will improve stability
- Backward will reduce stability
