TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::2 Trim and Static Stability



START_CARD
Basic

If a aircraft yaw's, how does the fuselage and the tail contribute to it's directional stability.

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230410162722.png]]

- As the plane yaw's the tail recieves a non zero AOA inducing a corresponding lift force
- The tail is (basically always) behind the centre of mass, the lift force will induce a moment that aligns the plane to the flow direction
- Increasing directional stability

- The fuselage often creates a destabilising contribution (since often the CG is far back)
- (Usually) Decreasing directional stability

How can an aircraft compensate for sidewinds in takeoff/landing?

Back: 
- The aircraft can fly at an angle such that it's net movement is still along the runway

What are the 2 main factors when determining the minimum size of the rudder?

Back: 
- Achieving sufficient control during take off and landing
- Large enough to maintain control in the event of asymmetric engine failure

Describe how simple roll damping works.

Back: 
- The rolling motion causes one wing to move upward and the other to move downward
- The wing moving upward experiences a reduced angle of attack, producing decreased lift
- The wing moving downward experiences a increased angle of attack, producing increased lift
- This results in a net moment opposing the rolling movement

Why does a rolled aircraft produce sideslip?

Back: 
- The vertical component of the lift vector is cancelled out by the weight vector (vertical equilibrium) but the horizontal vector remains
- This horizontal force leads to sideslip

How does sideslip effect yaw?

Back: 
- As a plane experiences sideslip it moves to the side (shocking)
- This movement induces a drag force on the side of the plane
- The tail experiences a lot of force resulting in a yaw being induced turning in the direction of the sideslip

How can roll-yaw coupling lead to stability issues?

Back: 
- A aircraft that is rolled will experience sideslip
- The sideslip will cause yawing in the direction of that sideslip
- The yawing will induce a rolling force, potentially amplifying the current roll
- Depending on the aircrafts design this could lead to runaway effects

State and explain how does a dihedral wing responds to sideslip?

How does a high wing respond to sideslip? (skin friction response)

Back:  
- Under slideslip a wing will experience skin friction along it's surface
- A high wing will experience this force above the CG
- This will result in a rolling moment

How does a high wing respond to sideslip? (fuselage interference effect)

Back: 
- The fuselage changes the flow of the sideslip such that:
![[Pasted image 20230410172947.png]]

- If there is a wing nearby it will induce a increased AOA on one side and a decreased AOA on the other

How can do swept wings respond when experiencing sideslip?

Back: 
- When experiencing sideslip the free stream has a sideslip angle
- This means it will have a larger normal component along one wing than the other (assuming sweep)
- This leads to more lift on one wing and less on the other 
- In the case of a backwards sweep this will result in a restoring roll moment

Why might a aircraft use an anhedral wing?

Back: 
- An anhedral wing is the opposite to a dihedral wing
- It creates a destabilising effect
- For fighters they may be too stable, so want to decrease stability by using a anhedral wing
