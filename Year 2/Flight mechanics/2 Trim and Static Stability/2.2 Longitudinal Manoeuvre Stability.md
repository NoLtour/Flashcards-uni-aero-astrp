TARGET_DECK: Flight mechanics::2 Trim and Static Stability

Basic

Use the context of a constant rotation pitch up manoeuvre to describe load factor?

Back: 
- By constantly pitching up, the vehicle is travelling in a circular arc
- This effectively results in a centrifugal force, which amplifies weight. 
- We describe this effect using load factor
- In the diagram below the vehicle is instantaneously horizontal

The following are the equations for neutral point and static margin. What is the difference between these equations and manoeuvre neutral point and manoeuvre margin? Explain them.

$$ \begin{align}
h_{n} &= K \frac{C_{L_{T}, \alpha}}{C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}} + h_{0} &  H_{s} &\equiv h_{n} - h 
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- The definitions of the equations remain unchanged, though we do use different symbols:
$$ \begin{align}
h_{m} &= K \frac{C_{L_{T}, \alpha}}{C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}} + h_{0} &  H_{m} &\equiv h_{m} - h
\end{align} $$
- The difference comes in the value of $\frac{C_{L_{T}, \alpha}}{C_{L^{*}_{\alpha}}}$ 
- This changes due to the weight vector + centrifugal forces imparted on a aircraft during manoeuvre

- What is pitch damping?
- In a simple model of a plane, how does pitch damping arise?  
- How does this effect stability?

Back: 
- Pitch damping is some effect that creates a moment opposite to a pitching movement, which damps pitching.

- The pitching movement around the CG can be described as the rate of change of pitch: $\frac{d\gamma}{dt}$
- Since the angle of the plane is changing, the tail will have some degree of vertical movement
- This vertical movement will be upward in a pitch down case and downward in a pitch up case
- The effect this has on the angle of attack of the tail can be seen by incorporating the vertical vector into the freestream vector

- It can be seen that for a pitching motion the tailplane will produce a opposing moment, this is pitch dampening

- Since pitch dampening reduces the rate that a plane can change angle, it increases stability

Define load factor. How does it relate to turns?

Back: 
- Load factor is the total lift over the weight
$$ \begin{align}
n &\equiv \frac{L^{*}}{W} = \frac{C_{L^{*}}}{C_{W}}
\end{align} $$
- During a pitching manoeuvre the vehicle will travel along an arc, this value is useful when quantifying the force needed to achieve that arc

n - 1 &= \frac{V^{2}}{gR}
\end{align} $$
For the equation above:
- What does it describe
- Name each of it's variables
- 


Back: 
- This equation describes the relationship between load factor and a pitching manoeuvre
- $n$ is load factor
- $V$ is aircraft velocity
- $g$ is gravitational acceleration
- $R$ is the radius of curvature for the pitching manoeuvre

$$ \begin{align}
n - 1 &= \frac{V^{2}}{gR}
\end{align} $$
In this equation what do the different values of $R$ mean interms of the current manoeuvre?

Back: 
- $R<0$ means that the aircraft is pitching down
- $R>0$ means the aircraft is pitching up
- $R=\pm\infty$ means there is no pitching manoeuvre

If a aircraft's load factor is 0 what does that imply about it's current motion?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
n - 1 &= \frac{V^{2}}{gR}
\end{align} $$
- It means the aircraft is pitching downwards

If a aircraft's load factor is 1 what does that imply about it's current motion?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
n - 1 &= \frac{V^{2}}{gR}
\end{align} $$
- It means the aircraft is not pitching

In the context of manoeuvring flight. How is mass parameter effected if I:
- Increase mass
- Increase the distance to the tailplane

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\Phi &= \frac{\rho S l}{2 m}
\end{align} $$

- Increasing the mass will decrease the mass parameter
- Increasing the distance to the tailplane will increase mass parameter

$$ \begin{align}
\alpha_{T_{eff}} &= (1-\varepsilon_{\alpha})\alpha + \varepsilon_{\alpha} \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{S} - \frac{C_{L_{T}}}{\pi A_{T} e_{T}} + (n-1) C_{W} \Phi 
\end{align} $$

For this equation name each variable.

Back: 
- $\alpha_{T_{eff}}$ the effective angle of attack of the tail
- $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ the change of $\varepsilon$ (the downwash of the main wing) with change in $\alpha$
- $\alpha$ the AOA
- $\alpha_{S}$ the setting angle of the tail
- $\alpha_{0}$ the no lift angle of the main wing
- $C_{L_{T}}$ the coefficient of lift of the tail
- $A_{T}$ the tail aspect ratio
- $e_{T}$ the tail oswald efficiency factor
- $n$ the load factor
- $C_{W}$ the weight coefficient
- $\Phi$ the mass parameter

$$ \begin{align}
C_{L_{T,\alpha}} = k \left[\frac{1 - \varepsilon_{\alpha} + \Phi C_{L_{\alpha}} }{1 - k \Phi \frac{S_{T}}{S} }\right]
\end{align} $$

What does this equation tell us about aircraft stability:
- During/outside manoeuvre
- With increased altitude
- With aircraft weight

Back: 
- This can be compared to the regular steady level flight version: 
$$ \begin{align}
C_{L_{T,\alpha}} &= k (1 - \varepsilon_{\alpha}) 
\end{align} $$
- It can be seen that during manoeuvre the $C_{L_{T,\alpha}}$ will be higher
- This will lead to increased aircraft stability

- As altitude increases, density decreases
- If density decreases $\Phi$ decreases
- This reduces $C_{L_{T,\alpha}}$
- This shows that as altitude increases the stability improvements during manoeuvre will decrease

- As weight decreases, $\Phi$ increases
- This increases $C_{L_{T,\alpha}}$
- This shows that lighter aircraft will have more pitch damping compared to heavier ones

$$ \begin{align}
h_{m} &= h_{0} + K \frac{C_{L_{T,\alpha}}}{ C_{L_{\alpha}} + C_{L_{T,\alpha}} \frac{S_{T}}{S} } 
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- $h_{m}$ is the neutral point for a manoeuvre
- $h_{0}$ is the distance from the main wing aerodynamic centre to the centre of gravity
- $K$ is the tail volume fraction
- $C_{L_{T,\alpha}}$ is how the tail lift coefficient changes with AOA
- $C_{L_{\alpha}}$ is how the main wing lift coefficient changes with AOA
- $S_{T}/S$ is the tail wing area divided by the main wing area

Where is the manoeuvre point relative to the neutral point? What does this tell us?

Back: 
- The manoeuvre point is the neutral point during a manoeuvre
- Typically it is located behind the neutral point
- This tells us that aircraft are typically more stable during a manoeuvre
