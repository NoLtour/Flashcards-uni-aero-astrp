What stays constant and what chages in chemical reaction?
#card 

- Mass stays constant
- number of molecules will change


What is atmospheric nitrogen and what is it used for?#
#card 

- Compisition of Nitrogen and other gasses which normally don't take part in the reaction

What is a Stoictometric ratio and when is it classfied as that?
#card 

- An air-fuel mixture is called stoichiometric when there is exactly enough air (or oxygen) for complete combustion
- The ratio of the coefficients of the products and reactants in a balanced reaction
- for example ![[Pasted image 20230403160910.png]]


What is the eqivalence ratio and the three air-fuel regimes associated with it?
#card 

-  equivalence ratio Ï† is the ratio between the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio to the actual air-fuel
ratio
