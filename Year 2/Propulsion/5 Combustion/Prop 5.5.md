Basic

What happens to the reactants and products if the reaction is described as fuel lean

Back: 

- reaction products will contain both CO2 and O2, which will form an equilibrium with CO as per equation

What does the following stand for and what property is it dependant on?![[Pasted image 20230502021314.png]] 

Back: 
-  Ktheta is a equilibrium constant, which is dependent on the temperature and can be found in table 5 of the data book

Basic

What are the steps to determine the molar (or volumetric) composition of CO, CO2 and O2 at a given temperature and pressure

Back: 
- Step 1: write the chemical reaction and sub  a, b, and c  for the unknown number of kmols of each product
- Step 2:  write down relations between our unknowns using atom conservation and choose any of the products (CO, O2 or CO2) to solve.
- Step 3:  look in table 5 of the data book for the equilibrium constant corresponding to our equilibrium equation for the given temperature
- Step 4: replace the partial pressures with our parameters a, b, and c, using the molar fraction and the given pressure
- Step 5: solve the equation for  the unknown constants
