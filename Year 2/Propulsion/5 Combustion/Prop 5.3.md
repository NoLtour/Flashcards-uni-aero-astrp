What is atmospheric nitrogen and how is it different from pure nitrogen?

Back: 
- Compisition of Nitrogen and other gasses which normally don't take part in the reaction
- Atmospheric nitrogen data is given different to a pure nitrogen data in the data table

What is a Stoictometric ratio and  is the below equation classfied as Stoictometric ?
![[Pasted image 20230403170417.png]]

Back: 
-  An air-fuel mixture is called stoichiometric when there is exactly enough air (or oxygen) for complete combustion
- Yes as the ratio of the coefficients of the products and reactants is 1 thefore the reaction is balanced

What is the eqivalence ratio and the three air-fuel regimes associated with it?

Back: 
-   equivalence ratio Ï† is the ratio between the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio to the actual air-fuel
ratio

 Calculate complete combustion for a reaction

Back: 
 
1) balance carbon
2) balance hydrogen
3) balance oxygen
4)  Multiply by 2 if you have a fraction.
