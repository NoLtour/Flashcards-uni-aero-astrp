The temperature at the outlet of an adiabatic isobaric combustor is also known as 

Back: 
- adiabatic flame temperature

Explain what happens to each variable for the steady flow energy equation for the adiabatic combustion process

Back: 
-  $\dot{Q}=$ = 0 (adiabatic)
-  $\dot{W}=$ = 0 (constant pressure)
- hout = hin, so there is no enthalpy change in an adiabatic combustion process
- The adiabatic process will however have a change in temperature however no change in entropy as thermal energy is exactly equal to the change in chemical energy, so that together they add up to zero.

Explain what happens to each variable for the steady flow energy equation for the isothermal combustion process

Back: 
- $\dot{Q}=$𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑚𝑓𝐿𝐶V
-  $\dot{W}=$ 
-  hout does equal hin as heat is removed
- all the heat that is produced by the combustion process is removed such that the products leave the combustor at the same temperature as the reactants entered it. This will result in a change in enthalpy, which is equal to the change in chemical energy.

Steps to derive Adiabatic Flame Temperature Fomula:
Use the following formula to help
![[Pasted image 20230502035542.png]]

Back: 
-   $\dot{Q}=$ = 0 (adiabatic)
-  $\dot{W}=$ = 0 (constant pressure)
-  Substitue relevant formulas for  products and rectants
-  divide by  $\dot{m}$ and replace with (AFR + 1)  where appropriate
- divide by (AFR + 1)Cp,p
- Rearrange for T2
