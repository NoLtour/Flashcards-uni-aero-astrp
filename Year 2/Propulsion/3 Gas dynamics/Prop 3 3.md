For the following equation: $a=\sqrt{ \gamma RT }$
- Name it's variables
- Describe it's meaning
- State limitiations and applicability
#card 
- This is the equation for the speed of sound in an ideal gas
- $a=$ local speed of sound
- $\gamma=$ specific heat ratio
- $R=$ specific gas constant
- It shows that in a given ideal gas the speed of sound is only a function of temperature (of course gas properties matter but for a given sample $R,\gamma$ don't change)
- Doesn't apply if not working with an ideal gas
- The derivation comes from an isentropic assumption! So the equation will not work when entropy is changing or heat is being transferred! 


For the following equation: $\text{Ma} = \frac{U}{a}$
- Name it's variables
- Describe it's meaning
- State limitiations and applicability
#card 
- This is the defenition mach number
- $a=$ local speed of sound
- $\text{Ma}=$ Mach number
- $U=$ velocity between some refrence and the fluid
- Mach number is a dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound


For the following equation: $\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}} = 1+ \frac{\gamma-1}{2} \text{Ma}^{2}_{1}$
- Name it's variables
- Describe it's meaning
- State limitiations and applicability
#card 
- This equation is derived from combining the equations for speed of sound, mach number and stagnation temperature
- $\text{Ma}=$ Mach number
- $\gamma=$ specific heat ratio
- $T_{0}=$ stagnation temperature
- It can be used to relate the mach number of the fluid to it's temperature at any point along the fluid?
- The derivation assumes a ideal gas
- The derivation will not work across a normal shock since there is a change in entropy?

What are critical properties?
#card 
- They are properties of a fluid which are at a mach number of 1 (the local speed of sound)


If I isothermally increase the pressure for a ideal gas, how does the speed of sound change?
#card 
- It doesn't change as for an ideal gas speed of sound is only a function of temperature

- This is the equation for critical pressure in an ideal gas
- $P*$ is critical pressure
- $P_{0}$ is the stagnation pressure
- $\gamma=$ specific heat ratio

For the following equation: $a^{2} = \frac{dP}{d\rho}$
- Name it's variables
- Describe it's meaning
- State limitiations and applicability
#card 
- This is an equation which can be derived when dealing with small disturbances moving at the speed of sound along a constent diameter column
- $a$ is the local speed of sound, $P$ is pressure, $\rho$ is density
- It's derivation assumes an isentropic process
- It's derivation assumes small disturbances
