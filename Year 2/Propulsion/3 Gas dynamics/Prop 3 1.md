What is an ideal gas?

Back: 
An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions (collision time, interparticle forces ect). 
It is a useful concept as it leads to the ideal gas law: $V=\rho RT$

What is the equation for momentum conservation on a control volume?

Back: 
#card  
> ### $$  \vec{F}  = \sum\limits \vec{P}_{n} A_{n} + \sum\limits_{\text{in}} \vec{V}_{n} \dot{m}_{n}   - \sum\limits_{\text{out}} \vec{V}_{n} \dot{m}_{n}  $$
>> where:
>> $\vec{V}_{n} \dot{m}_{n}=$ the momentum of the mass flow of some input/output from the control volume
>> $\vec{F}=$ resultant force acting on the control volume (usually your solving for this)
>> $\vec{P}_{n} A_{n}=$ Pressure over area acting over a side of the control volume
