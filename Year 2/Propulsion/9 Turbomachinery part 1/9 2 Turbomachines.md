TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::9 Turbomachinery part 1




START_CARD
Basic

Describe the difference between an axial and radial turbomachine. Then give an example of each.

Back: 
- Axial flow turbomachines, such as a multis-stage compressor and high-pressure turbine stage have minimal velocity in the radial direction. 
- Radial flow machines, such as the q rocket propellant pump, have practically no axial flow velocity at inlet to or outlet from the rotor.

In this image the top half is axial flow and bottom half is radial flow.
