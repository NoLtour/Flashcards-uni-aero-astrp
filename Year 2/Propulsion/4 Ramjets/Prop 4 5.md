TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::4 Ramjets



START_CARD
Basic

Describe how combustion efficiency is limited at high speeds in a ramjet.

Back: 
- At high speeds converting the supersonic flow to subsonic will produce a very large pressure ratio and therefore temperature increase
- The high temperature would hinder efficient combustion, and would put too much stress on materials.

How does a scramjet's operation differ from a ramjet?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230404124438.png]]
- In a scramjet the combustion occurs at supersonic speeds, compared to a ramjet where combustion is subsonic
- This means that a scramjets diffusor only has converging sections it's nozzle is purely diverging, which is different to a ramjet
- Since a scramjet combusts at supersonic speeds it has a much higher operating range ~mach 12-15
- Unlike ramjets, scramjets can only operate at near hypersonic speeds meaning much more effort must be put into getting it upto operational speed before it can produce it's own thrust

What are the main challanges for a scramjet once it is at it's operational speed?

Back: 
- Fuel mixing
- Flame stability
