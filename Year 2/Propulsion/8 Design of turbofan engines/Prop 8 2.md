What is an engine spool? How many spools does the following engine have?

![[Pasted image 20230507175304.png]]

Back: 
- This is the mechanical connection between a compressor and turbine blade set, they are on a single spool and hence operate at a single rotation speed
- That engine has 2 spools.

What is the relationship between jet speed and engine noise?

Back: 
- Jet noise is a very high exponential function of jet speed (power of 8)

What is the issue with using gear boxes to control rotation speed in a jet engine?

Back: 
- Gear boxes can get to efficiencies of ~99%
- Jet engines put absolute SHIT tones of energy through these shafts
- 1% of an absolute shit tone is more than enough to liquify most engines

What are some of the reasons why we use multiple spools?

Back: 
- It allows more optimisation of individual blades
- Greatly helps with engine startup requirements
- Allows for greater power density HPC can go FAAAST, so less material needed

What is a turbofan engine?

- This is where a fan is connected to the engine to convert power to thrust
- In this example it can be seen the LPC is directly connected to the fan
- Modern turbofans produce the majority of their thrust from the fans (to increase propulsive efficiency)

What is a turboprop engine?

- The primary difference is the operating speeds and fan style
- Practically it's basically just a turbofan with a bigger fan that can't go at high speeds because propellers are cringe
- They tend to be more efficient
- Basically all thrust is produced from the propeller instead of  the jet

What is a turboelectric propulsion system.

- Cringe
- This is where the gas turbine powers a generator which then electrically drives the fans in other sections of the aircraft
- Since they can be placed anywhere higher bypass ratios can be achieved and they can be put in aerodynamically beneficial locations
