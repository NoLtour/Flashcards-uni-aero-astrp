What is bypass ratio?

Back: 
- The mass flow bypassing the engine core over the mass flow through the engine core

What is the fan pressure ratio?

Back: 
- The ratio of the pressure before the fan vs after the fan

For a fixed thrust how does the fan pressure ratio and bypass ratio relate?

Back: 
- A higher fan pressure ratio means that the velocity at the outlet will be greater, hence to keep a constant thrust you'd have to decrease mass flow rate and hence bypass ratio

Explain the following graph and it's implications in turbofan design.

Back: 
- This shows how specific thrust and specific fuel consumption vary with fan pressure ratio
- Specific thrust is effectively just the speed of the air exiting the jet
- (Bare) Specific fuel consumption is the fuel needed per unit thrust
- It can be seen that a higher fan pressure ratio results in reduced efficiency

What is the equation for fpr?

Back: 
- fpr is fan pressure ratio:
$$ \begin{align}
\text{fpr} &= \frac{P_{02}}{P_{a}}
\end{align} $$

- This is the ratio of stagnation pressures across the fan (after fan divided by before fan)

How can fan pressure ratio be used to determine $T_{013}$?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\text{Fan pressure ratio:}&&\text{fpr} &= \frac{P_{02}}{P_{a}}\\
\text{Isentropic relation:}&& \frac{T}{P^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}} &= k & &\to &\\
\end{align} $$
