What is bypass ratio?

Back: 
- The mass flow bypassing the engine core over the mass flow through the engine core

What is the fan pressure ratio?

Back: 
- The ratio of the pressure before the fan vs after the fan

For a fixed thrust how does the fan pressure ratio and bypass ratio relate?

Back: 
- A higher fan pressure ratio means that the velocity at the outlet will be greater, hence to keep a constant thrust you'd have to decrease mass flow rate and hence bypass ratio

Explain the following graph and it's implications in turbofan design.

Back: 
- This shows how specific thrust and specific fuel consumption vary with fan pressure ratio
- Specific thrust is effectively just the speed of the air exiting the jet
- (Bare) Specific fuel consumption is the fuel needed per unit thrust
- It can be seen that a higher fan pressure ratio results in reduced efficiency
