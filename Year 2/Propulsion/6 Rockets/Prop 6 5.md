![[Pasted image 20230404171135.png]]

Operating principle:
- Fuel and oxidiser are driven into the combustion chamber using tank pressure
- The tank pressure may be due to a secondary gas (eg: helium) or by just the vaporization of the propellant
- The pressure must be greater than the combustion chamber pressure for propellant to be driven

Advantages:
- Very simple
	- Doesn't require start up system (just open valves and ignite)
	- Less weight
	- Cheap to manufacture and develop

Disadvantages: 
- Tank pressure limits function
- Limited thrust can be achieved

For a expander cycle rocket describe:
- It's operating principle
- It's advantages
- It's disadvantages

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230404171730.png]]

Operating principle:
- Fuel is pumped out of the reservoir
- The fuel is heated in a heat-exchanger on the nozzle (which is also providing the necessary cooling of the nozzle), and is then passed through a turbine
- This turbine then drives the fuel and oxidizer pumps
- The propellants then enter the combustion chamber and burn

Advantages:
- The expander cycle is more complex than the pressure driven system, but it is still a relatively simple system
- Because the turbine is driven just by fuel, and not exhaust products, this reduces the wear on the turbine 

Disadvantages: 
- The power that the turbine can deliver is limited by the amount of heat that can be extracted from the heat exchanger at the nozzle
	- This results in a size limitation, because an increase in engine size results in a volume that increases with the size cubed, while the surface area (and therefore the amount of heat that can be extracted) increases with the size squared.
- The expander cycle cannot start by itself: the heat exchanger will only work once the engine is running.

In the expander cycle engine above the fuel lines are changed such that only a part of the fuel is entering the turbine, with the fuel going through the turbine being discarded. What is the reason to do this?

Back:  
-  This means that some fuel is lost, but enables the turbine to operate on a larger pressure ratio, because the fuel leaving the turbine does not need to be pressurized to reach the combustion chamber (since it's being vented)
- The additional performance gained from the increased pressure ratio may be greater than the loss caused by wasting fuel

For a gas generator cycle rocket describe:
- It's operating principle
- It's advantages
- It's disadvantages

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230404172834.png]]

Operating principle:
- Fuel and oxidiser is pumped out of their reservoirs
- Some fuel + oxidiser passes through the pre-combustion chamber to drive the turbine for the pumps
- The remaining fuel is heated in a heat-exchanger on the nozzle (which is also providing the necessary cooling of the nozzle) 
- The propellants then enter the combustion chamber and burn

Advantages:
- The design is scalable since pump power is not dependent on the heat exchanger (in contrast to expansion cycles)
- The turbine can provide much greater power to pumps allowing for high chamber pressures and efficiency gains
- Throttling is possible, controlling the fuel/oxidiser entering the pre-combustion chamber controls the pump and hence the propellant flow rate

Disadvantages: 
- The hot gas on the turbine increases the wear on that part
- The pre combustion wastes propellant

For a gas generator cycle rocket describe:

- It's disadvantages

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230404172834.png]]

Operating principle:
- Fuel and oxidiser is pumped out of their reservoirs
- The  fuel is heated in a heat-exchanger on the nozzle (which is also providing the necessary cooling of the nozzle) 
- All the fuel and some oxidiser passes through the pre-combustion chamber to drive the turbine for the pumps
- The oxidiser quantity is used to limit the combustion in the pre-combustion chamber
- The propellants then enter the combustion chamber and burn

Advantages:
- The design is scalable since pump power is not dependent on the heat exchanger (in contrast to expansion cycles)
- The turbine can provide much greater power to pumps allowing for high chamber pressures and efficiency gains
- Throttling is possible, controlling the oxidiser entering the pre-combustion chamber controls the pump and hence the propellant flow rate
- It is very high efficiency and can achieve very high thrusts 
- Based

Disadvantages: 
-  The turbine is getting raped by very high flow rates and temperatures
- Insanely complex
