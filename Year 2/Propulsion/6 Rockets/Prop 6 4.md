- The solid propellant typically contains both the fuel and the oxidizer.
- There is a perforation through the center of the rocket, which acts as the combustion chamber, and will increase in size as the propellant is consumed.
- The exhaust is then propelled out of a nozzle to provide thrust

Basic

How can the thrust from a solid rocket be controlled?

Back: 
- Once the rocket is ignited, there is no further control possible, and the rocket cannot be stopped and started again.
- It is however possible to design the grain structure such that there is desirable time dependent thrust
