- Deadweight mass - $m_{dw}$ - The mass of structure of the stage, also called structure mass

Define the following equation and name it's variables:
$$ \begin{align}
\text{MR} &= \frac{m_{0}}{m_{bo}}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This is the equation for a rockets mass ratio, which is the ratio of initial mass to burnout mass. It will always be greater than 1.
- $\text{MR}$ is rocket mass ratio
- $m_{0}$ is initial mass
- $m_{bo}$ is burnout mass

$$ \begin{align}
\text{MR} &= \frac{m_{0}}{m_{bo}}= \frac{m_{bo}+m_{p}}{m_{bo}}

For the equation above:
- Name it's variables
- Describe it's meaning
- State limitations and applicability
Back: 
- This is the rocket equation which gives velocity change as a function of mass change
- ${\delta}$ is  deadweight mass to initial mass ratio
- ${\lambda}$ is  payload mass to initial mass ratio
- $\text{MR}$ is rocket mass ratio
- $m_{0}$ is initial mass
- $m_{bo}$ is burnout mass
- $c_{e}$ is effective exhaust velocity
- $\Delta V_{\text{ideal}}$ is the ideal change in velocity due to thrust
- This equation assumes that there are no forces acting on the rocket other than thrust but apart from that makes no assumptions

What are the variables in the following equation and what is it describing?
$$ \begin{align}
\Delta V &= c_{e} \ln\left(\frac{m_{0}}{m_{b0}}\right) - \int^{t}_{0} g \sin\psi \: dt - \int^{t}_{0} \frac{D}{m} \: dt

- This is the rocket equation after accounting for gravity and drag losses
- $m_{0}$ is initial mass
- $m_{bo}$ is burnout mass
- $m$ is instantaneous mass of the rocket
- $c_{e}$ is effective exhaust velocity
- $\Delta V$ is the change in velocity due to thrust
- $g$ is local gravitational acceleration
- $\psi$ is the angle between the direction of thrust and the normal to the direction of gravity (upright it is $90\degree$)
- $D$ is the force of drag

What can be done to minimise the effect of gravity drag?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
(\Delta V)_{g} &= \int^{t}_{0} g \sin\psi \: dt
\end{align} $$
To decrease it you can:
- Fly at a shallow angle
- Decreasing the time spent during a burn
- Decrease the period of the burn in high gravity area's (be high)

What can be done to minimise the effect of drag drag?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
(\Delta V)_{D} &= \int^{t}_{0} \frac{D}{m} \: dt
\end{align} $$
To decrease it you can:
- Decreasing the time spent during a burn
- Fly slowly through regions of high density
	- To achieve this you may want to fly vertically for the fastest decrease in air density

What is a gravity turn?

Back: 
- In practice, launches start vertically with relatively low speeds and accelerations, which occurs quite naturally because the mass is highest at lift-off. 
- After that, the angle Ïˆ is reduced quite rapidly to reduce gravity losses in a manoeuvre called a gravity turn.

Why don't we make everything an SSTO?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\Delta V_{\text{ideal}} = c_{e} \ln \left(\frac{m_{0}}{m_{bo}}\right) 
\end{align} $$
- The rocket equation shows us that we get diminishing returns for just adding more fuel, in the context of gravity eventually "more fuel" just doesn't help
- By introducing staging and dumping unneeded components (empty tanks, engines ect) we can overcome this issue

What is the following equation, name all it's variables.
$$ \begin{align}
\lambda_{i} &= \exp\left( - \frac{\Delta V_{i}}{c_{e,i}} \right) - \delta_{i}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This equation describes the payload mass to initial mass ratio that can be achieved for a specific non dimensionalised rocket.
- $\lambda_{i}$ is payload mass to initial mass ratio for stage $i$ 
- ${\delta_{i}}$ is  deadweight mass to initial mass ratio for stage $i$
- $\Delta V_{i}$ is the delta V that is achieved by stage i
- $c_{e,i}$ is the effective exhaust velocity for stage i

Why don't we just keep adding stages forever? What number of stages provides the largest performance improvement?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230404164514.png]]
- Consecutive stages need to carry each other, so the first one must be larger than the second ect
- This results in an exponential relationship as stage size increases, which is how you get absolutely ridiculous rockets like the Saturn 5
- Additionally stages provide lots of added complexity
- The largest improvement in performance comes from going from 1 to 2 stages, as you'd expect due to diminishing returns with additional staging

How can total payload to initial mass ratio be calculated using a the payload to initial mass ratio's of the rockets constituent stages?

Back: 
- By multiplying them together:
$$ \begin{align}
\lambda &= \lambda_{1} \times \lambda_{2} \times \lambda_{3} \times ... \times \lambda_{n}
\end{align} $$
