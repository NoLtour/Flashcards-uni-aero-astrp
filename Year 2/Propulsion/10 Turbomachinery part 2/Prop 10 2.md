State the equation and variable names for the flow coefficient. (turbomachines)

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\phi &= \frac{V_{x}}{U}
\end{align} $$

- $\phi$ is the flow coefficient
- $V_{x}$ is the axial flow velocity
- $U$ is the blade speed

What does flow coefficient tell us about how staggered the blades are?

Back: 
- A stage designed with a low value of ùúô generally implies highly staggered blades with the relative flow angles close to tangential. 
- High values imply low stagger and flow angles closer to axial.

$$ \begin{align}
\phi &= \frac{V_{x}}{U}
\end{align} $$

- Low value $\to$ near axial flow
- High value $\to$ near tangential flow

Why do we need to operate turbomachinery over a narrow range of flow coefficients?

Back: 
- For blades to operate effectively the flow incidence angle on the leading edge should be near zero
- The flow coefficient measures to some extent the angle of the flow
- If the flow coefficient is changing from it's design value then the turbomachinery is probably not going to have good incidence on it's flow and loose efficiency

Using the context of flow coefficient, why do we narrow the cross section of the compressor?

Back: 
- In a multistage axial flow compressor flow radius is constant(ish), so blade speed ($U$) is constant(ish) for the same spool
- To keep the flow coefficient at it's design value we therefor need to keep $V_{x}$ constant
- Between stages the flow density increases (compressed, duh), which if cross section is constant then axial velocity will drop
- To compensate for this we reduce the cross section, meaning $V_{x}$ is constant(ish) and flow coefficient is constant(ish)
- Since area drops blade height will obviously also drop.

State the equation and variable names for the stage loading coefficient. (turbomachines)

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\psi &= \frac{\Delta h_{0}}{U^{2}}
\end{align} $$

- $\psi$ is stage loading coefficient
- $\Delta h_{0}$ is stagnation enthalpy
- $U$ is blade speed

What does the following equation tell you about the meaning of stage loading coefficient?

$$ \begin{align}
\Delta h_{0}= U V_{x} ( &\tan \alpha_{3} - \tan \alpha_{2}) & &\to & \frac{\Delta h_{0}}{U^{2}}=  \frac{V_{x}}{U} ( &\tan \alpha_{3} - \tan \alpha_{2})
\end{align} $$

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\frac{\Delta h_{0}}{U^{2}} &=  \frac{V_{x}}{U} (  \tan \alpha_{3} - \tan \alpha_{2})\\
\psi &=  \phi (  \tan \alpha_{3} - \tan \alpha_{2})
\end{align} $$
- We know that $\phi$ is flow coefficient (a measure of how tangential the flow is)
- The magnitude of $(  \tan \alpha_{3} - \tan \alpha_{2})$ will increase as the exit angles from the blades increases
- So $\psi$ describes the indidence angle times the deflection angle, which is a measure of how much the blades are deflecting the flow
- Hence low stage loading implies low deflection of flow and the blades extracting/inputting little energy
- High stage loading would imply the opposite

Write a simple expression for stage loading coefficient. Describe how it's derived. Then describe what it implies about stage loading.

Back: 
- This equation is derived using the defenition of stage loading and eulers equation
$$ \begin{align}
\psi = \frac{\Delta V_{\theta}}{U}
\end{align} $$
- This equation shows that high loading implies a high ŒîùëâùúÉ, and hence blades with a large amount of flow turning
- High stage loading means doing more with less machinery and is desirable
