TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::7 Gas Turbine Engines



START_CARD
Basic

State 4 differences between an ideal Brayon cycle engine and a real gas turbine.

Back: 
- The turbo-machinery is not isentropic.
- There is a pressure loss in the combustor. (not isobaric combustion)
- 𝑐𝑝 and γ vary with temperature. (not a ideal gas)
- 𝑐𝑝 for combustion products is higher than 𝑐𝑝 for air.
- Combustion occurs internally instead of heat being supplied externally.
- The addition of fuel in the combustor increases the mass flow rate in the turbine.
- The turbine exhaust is released to the atmosphere (i.e. it is not a cycle).

Basic

State 2 differences between the operation of a typical brayton cycle engine and a turbine for aircraft operation.

Back: 
- The engine inlet conditions vary as a function of altitude and speed
- There is no work externally extracted from the turbine (unless they are used for some electrical power for subsystems)
- The downstream back pressure may be different to upstream pressure due to aerodynamic effects of the vehicle (pressure difference across the nozzle)
