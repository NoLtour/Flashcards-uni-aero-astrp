Basic

For an ideal Brayton cycle:
- State the process between each step
- Describe the operation

Back: 
- ($1 \to 2$) Isentropic compression. Air is drawn into the compressor and pressurised, work is done to compress it.
- ($2 \to 3$) Isobaric combustion. The compressed air is burned with fuel, in this ideal model it is shown as pure heat addition.
- ($3 \to 4$) Isentropic expansion. The hot exhaust is expanded and work is extracted, some work goes back to drive the compressor.
- ($4 \to 1$) Isobaric process. This is called heat rejection, it's added for calculation reasons but doesn't exist in reality.

- Isentropic - Constant entropy
- Isobaric - Constant pressure
