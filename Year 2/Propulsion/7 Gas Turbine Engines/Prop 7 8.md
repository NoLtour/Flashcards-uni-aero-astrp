What is afterburning? 

Back: 
- This is where additional fuel is burned after the turbine (since it's cooler there, the turbine is already at the temperatures max operating temp)
- Doing so increases the temperature which increases the speed of sound, hence increasing the flow velocity through the choked section of the nozzle
- This increases the thrust

What is the practicality of a afterburner?

Back: 
- After-burners are terrible for efficiency, so they are not something we generally add to a vehicle for normal operation
- They are ideal for aircraft that occasionally need increased thrust (such as a fighter)

Why are variable-area convergent divergent nozzles fitted to afterburning jet engines?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230507163431.png]]
- To account for the difference in area needed for when the afterburner is engaged
	- When active more fuel is burned, hence mass flow increases
	- When active the exit temperature increases, more flow can pass through the throat as speed of sound increases
