This graph shows values relevant to a idealised gas turbine, what is it representing? Explain the relationship.

Back: 
- The lines show various compressor/turbine efficiency's
- The y axis shows the cycle efficiency
- The x axis shows the pressure ratio

- For situations where the turbomachinery isn't 100% efficient, entropy is produced in operation
- This means that there is a direct positive relationship between energy used for compression and energy loss (because comp/turb inefficiency)
- So as you increase the pressure ratio more and more energy is lost to inefficiency, which counteracts the gains from increased compression ratio

Back: 
- The y axis shows the non-dimensionalised work output of the engine
- The x axis is pressure ratio
- This assumes a 90% efficient compressor and turbine
- Each line is showing the relationship at a particular temperature ratio ($T_4$ is the stagnation temperature exiting the combustion chamber, $T_{2}$ is the stagnation temperature entering the compressor)

What does the following graph tell us about practical use of gas turbines? Why does this relationship exist?
![[Pasted image 20230507145356.png]] 

Back:  
	- The compressor and turbine are only 90% efficient
	- This means that there is a direct positive relationship between energy used for compression and energy loss (because comp/turb inefficiency)
	- So as you increase the pressure ratio more and more energy is lost to inefficiency, which counteracts the gains from increased compression ratio
	- This chart specifically shows that with increased temp ratio efficiency increases, this is because more total energy is extracted so a lower proportion's wasted in the compression
	- To achieve this  more fuel can be added to drive up the temp ratio between compressor inlet and combustion chamber outlet

What are the main limiting phenomena in increasing the temperature in a gas turbine combustion chamber? What is the net impact of these factors?

Back: 
- Creep, for a jet engine to work well it needs:
	- High turbine speeds (leading to really high centrifugal forces)
	- High temperatures (bad 4 creep)
	- Tight tolerances (creep will eat these)

- Oxidation (greatly accelerated by temperature increase)

- Thermal fatigue

- It's clear that each of these mechanisms become much more severe with increasing temperature, so to practically run a jet engine we've got to make sure the materials only reach a fraction of their actual maximum operating temperature.

What is conductive and film cooling? How are they related?

Back: 
- Conductive cooling is where a fluid is passed inside the turbine blades to cool them, often this air is sourced from before the combustion chamber where temps are low (about 800K, this is relative lol).
- Film cooling is where small holes in the surface of the turbine are used to push a "cool" film over the blade acting as a cooling agent and creating a protective layer
- Generally both are used at once

How are ceramics currently used in turbines?

Back: 
- Ceramics are hella based, they work at super high temps, don't corrode, don't creep... but they are too brittle for current practical implementation
- There is research into using them as blades but can't rn
- Currently ceramics see use as thermal barrier coatings
