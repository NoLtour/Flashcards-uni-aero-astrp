TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::7 Gas Turbine Engines



START_CARD
Basic

State and explain the effect on the efficiency of a Brayton cycle engine, when the turbomachinery is not assumed to be isentropic.

Back: 
- If the turbomachineary is not 100% efficient, then some useful energy will be converted into waste heat (entropy). 
- This is a cumulative effect since the compressor will need more input work and the turbine will extract less work. For example if both the compressor and turbine are only 90% efficient then the net effect is a ~14.3% drop in efficiency.

Basic

State and explain the effect on the efficiency of a Brayton cycle engine, when the engine is described as a turbojet at mach 0.8.


Back: 
- Firstly the high mach number will lead to ram compression
	- This increases the pressure ratio, and improves efficiency
- Secondly in a jet the exhaust is mostly used to provide thrust through the nozzle rather than a turbine, which generally allows more useful extraction of energy

Basic

State and explain the effect on the efficiency of a Brayton cycle engine, when the single perfect gas assumption is dropped.

Back: 
- The fuel addition itself represents a small amount of mass, but the act of burning it changes the properties of the working fluid significantly. Especially the heat capacity.
- The loss of the perfect gas assumption actually improves efficiency (a very small amount)
- The change of the CP between the inputs and products leads to a significant loss of efficiency.
