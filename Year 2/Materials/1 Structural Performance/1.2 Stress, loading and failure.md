In the context of stress concentration what is a plastic zone. Describe it's formation and effect.

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230427185601.png]]
- When a stress concentration exceeds the materials yield stress, it can plastically deform
- This deformation redistributes the stress in a pattern as seen above
- The effect of this is increased resistance to cracking, with more seen in more plastic materials
- This zone of plasticity is known as the plastic ZONE (shocking)

How does the inclusion of a plastic zone change the basic Griffeth approach equation?

Back: 
- The Griffeth approach essentially characterises 2 things: the energy that the crack can store and the energy acting on the crack
- The plastic region means that additional work is needed to expand the crack, hence cracks can store increased energy
- This means that the equation requires additional terms to account for the influence of plasticity.

Name the variables in the following equation and describe what it is.

$$ \begin{align}
\frac{\sigma_{f}^{2} \pi a}{E} &= 2 (\gamma_{e} + \gamma_{p})
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This equation is a relationship derived from the Griffith approach which accounts for the materials plasticity.
- It descibes the relationship between defect length and global stress across a crack, after using a Griffith approach.
- $\sigma_{f}$ is the global fracture stress. The stress applied across the object in question without accounting for stress concentration which will cause fracture.
- $a$ is the defect length, which is the crack radius
- $E$ is the materials Youngs modulus
- $\gamma_{e}$ is the crack work term. This describes the energy that can be held in the crack surface.
- $\gamma_{p}$ is the plastic area work term. This describes the energy needed to expand the crack.

Define toughness. 

Back: 
- Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy up to fracture, so it is equivalent to the area under the stress strain curve.
- It's obvious why tough materials are impact resistant, because the total energy they can absorbs much higher

$$ \begin{align}
K_{C} &= Q \sigma_{f} \sqrt{ \pi a_{c} }
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- Name and briefly describe each variable
- State what the equation describes

Back: 
-  $K_{C}$ is critical stress intensity factor, this is the stress intensity factor at which a crack will experience failure. 
- $Q$ is shape factor, this is a variable relating to how the external shape of the structure concentrates the stress in a particular region
- $\sigma_{f}$ fracture stress, this is the global stress which when applied will lead to failure
- $a_{c}$ is the critical crack radius
- This equation describes the relationship between crack radius and stress at the point of failure.

How does the inclusion of a plastic zone effect the model of stress intensity factor ($K$)? Under what conditions can it be ignored.

Back: 
- Since it redistributes the stress around the edge of a crack it fucks with stress intensity factor calculations, which are derived from purely elastic-brittle assumptions
- If the plastic region is very small (1/50th of crack radius) then we can ignore it

Why is the width of a sheet relevant when applying the equation:


$$ \begin{align}
K_{C} &= Q \sigma_{f} \sqrt{ \pi a_{c} }
\end{align} $$

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230427193548.png]]
- This equation makes use of stress concentration factor, which is not a material constant outside of plane strain condition
- If the sheet is not wide enough then the centre will not have isostrain conditions, making application of the equation impractical

How does defect angle amplify the effect of mode 1 loading?

Back: 
- A given material is likely to have defects in basically every orientation
- Due to this, at least one defect is likely to be in mode 1 loading. This single defect can be enough to initiate failure

Describe and explain the fracture surface seen for a brittle torsional failure.

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230427195521.png]]
-  Any material probably has lots of tiny defects in it in many orientations
- Some will therefore be at 45 degrees and experience Mode 1 loading when under load
- since it's brittle the cracks can't reorientate themselves into a lower stress state
- So you get brittle failure at 45 degree angles along these opening loads, leading to the pattern seen

Describe and explain the fracture surface seen for a ductile torsional failure.

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230427195724.png]]
-  Any material probably has lots of tiny defects in it in many orientations
- Some will therefore be at 45 degrees and experience Mode 1 loading when under load
- Since it's ductile the cracks can reorient themselves, the forces involved will stretch the cracks to be at 90 degrees
- The loading conditions on the cracks will be Mode II
- At failure it will shear leading to a flat surface

What are beach marks?

Back: 
- Beach marks are macroscopic progression marks on a fatigue fracture or stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) surface
- They indicate successive positions of the advancing crack front
- They radiate outward from one or more crack origins

What are striations, describe their meaning and characteristics.

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230427200619.png]]
- Striations mark the propagation of a crack front between cycles
- They are tiny and have to be observed using things like electron microscopes
- Other than that they are basically the same as beach marks
